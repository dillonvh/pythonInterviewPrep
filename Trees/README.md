# Tree Notes

## Traversals

### In-order

In this traversal method, the left subtree is visited first, then the root and later the right sub-tree.

### Pre-order

In this traversal method, the root node is visited first, then the left subtree and finally the right subtree.

### Post-order

In this traversal method, the root node is visited last, hence the name. First we traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree and finally the root node.
